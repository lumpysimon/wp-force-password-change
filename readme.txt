Require users to change their password on first login.

== Description ==

This plugin redirects newly-registered users to the *Admin -> Edit Profile* page when they first log in. Until they have changed their password, they will not be able to access either the front-end or other admin pages. An admin notice is also displayed informing them that they must change their password.

New administrators must also change their password, but as a safety measure they can also access the *Admin -> Plugins* page.
